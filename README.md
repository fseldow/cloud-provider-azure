Currently this repository is used for building and testing cloud-controller-manager for Azure, it references Azure cloud provider implementation code as [vendor dir](vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/cloudprovider/providers/azure). After handoff, the Azure cloud provider implementation will be moved here.
